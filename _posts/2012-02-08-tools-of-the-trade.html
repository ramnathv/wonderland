title: Tools of the Trade
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been working with <a href="http://www.mygovhub.org">GovHub</a> for going on three months now, and at this point I think I&#8217;ve finally gotten my development environment refined.</p>

<p>GovHub is built on <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org">Symfony 1.4</a> with the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine ORM</a>, and deployed on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> S3. Since we&#8217;re such a small team, I have my hands in pretty much every aspect of the development, and knowing which tools to use and when to use them is key.</p>

<p><strong>#1: <a href="http://mac.github.com/">Github for Mac</a></strong></p>

<p>Switching our version control from SVN to Git was like being born-again. Definitely one of those things where you can never imagine going back. Github does a great job hosting our repo, and their bug tracker &#8220;Issues&#8221; is fantastic as well.</p>

<p>Github for Mac is a beautiful application, but its abstraction layer is almost <em>too</em> thick. For everyday use it has a simple interface &amp; is easy to understand, but for things like merging branches and stashing changes I have no choice but to turn to the command line.</p>

<p><strong>#2: <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a></strong></p>

<p>Textmate is a cult favorite if there ever was one. (Apparently a screenshot of the long-awaited Textmate 2 in Alpha was the <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/12/12/screenshot-of-textmate-2-alpha-is-the-most-tweeted-photo-on-instagram-today/">most tweeted photo on instagram for a day</a>.) Switching from a full-blown IDE (Netbeans) to Textmate took a bit of configuration and adjustment. </p>

<p><em>Tip #1: </em>Install <a href="https://github.com/ciaran/projectplus">ProjectPlus</a>, which gives you an IDE-like sidebar for viewing your project&#8217;s files. It also gives you VCS support, if you&#8217;re into that thing. Personally, if I want to see which files I&#8217;ve modified, I just pop open Github for Mac.</p>

<p><em>Tip #2: </em>Use Command+T and Command+Shift+T. The former searches for files in your project, the latter searches for definitions within the currently-viewed file. What used to be a right click to &#8220;find declaration&#8221; in Netbeans is now a Command+T to search for the class, and possibly a Command+Shift+T to find the definition inside of it. Sure, it&#8217;s a little less convenient, but every time Netbeans would freeze up and then prompt me with &#8220;Netbeans was unresponsive for 6008ms, would you like to send a bug report?&#8221; I wanted to kill myself.</p>

<p><em>Tip #3: </em>Install <a href="https://github.com/protocool/AckMate">AckMate</a> for searching. Like a true UNIX noob, I didn&#8217;t know about <a href="http://betterthangrep.com/">ack</a> before using AckMate, so let me tell you: this shit is fucking fast. I can scan our entire 40MB codebase for a regular expression in ~10 seconds, and I don&#8217;t even know what the hell I&#8217;m doing most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>#3: <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>Alright, so I guess I&#8217;m working backwards, since I haven&#8217;t even gotten to MAMP yet. But Sequel Pro is amazing. Keeping our database sync&#8217;ed across our Production, Stage, and local servers would normally require that someone actually knows what they&#8217;re doing. Not with Sequel Pro: I can export our 360MB Production database and import it onto my local machine in less than 10 minutes. Brilliant, and a lot easier for now than creating a custom data set for local development.</p>

<p><em>Coming in Part Two: MAMP Pro, CCTray, s3cmd, SASS.</em></p>
